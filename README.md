# Hazel (Man) Sham

I come from a dynamic background in luxury retail, where I honed essential skills such as exceptional customer service, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic problem-solving. What excites me most about the tech industry is the endless potential for innovation and the opportunity to apply my skills in new and exciting ways. I have a strong desire to pivot into the tech world, particularly in the role of a full- stack developer. I am eager to be trained comprehensively, from front-end to back-end development, and leverage my diverse skill set to solve real-life problems through technology. I am actively seeking opportunities in tech where I can not only adapt to the fast-paced world of technology but also actively contribute to meaningful projects, all while continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
